# Explanation for Huffman Encoding and Decoding Implementation

## Choice of Data Structures and Algorithms

Huffman Tree Construction:

- **Priority Queue (Min Heap):** Used to efficiently select and merge nodes with the lowest frequency during the construction of the Huffman tree. This data structure ensures that the nodes with the lowest frequencies are always at the top, enabling efficient selection and merging.

Encoding and Decoding:

- **Dictionary:** Utilized to store the Huffman codes for each character. This choice facilitates quick lookup of codes during encoding and decoding operations, providing an efficient mapping between characters and their corresponding codes.

### Time Efficiency:

- **Construction of Huffman Tree:** The construction of the Huffman tree has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of unique characters in the input string. This is due to the overhead of iterating through the input string to compute character frequencies and the subsequent construction of the priority queue.
- **Encoding:** The encoding process has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because each character in the input string needs to be replaced with its corresponding Huffman code.
- **Decoding:** Similarly, the decoding process also has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the encoded data. This is because each bit in the encoded data needs to be traversed to decode the original string.

### Space Efficiency:

- **Construction of Huffman Tree:** The space complexity for constructing the Huffman tree is O(n), where n is the number of unique characters in the input string. This is due to the storage of nodes in the priority queue.
- **Encoding:** The space complexity for encoding is also O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the encoded data may contain additional bits compared to the original string, but the overhead is proportional to the size of the input string.
- **Decoding:** Similarly, the space complexity for decoding is O(n), where n is the length of the encoded data. The space overhead is proportional to the size of the encoded data.
