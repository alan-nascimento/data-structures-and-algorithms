# Queues

Another data structure that overlaps with arrays is a Queue. They are also similar to stacks, except they follow a FIFO approach (First in First Out).

The easiest way to implement a queue is using a Linked List.

There is also a variation of the queue, a double-ended queue, known as a deque (pronounced "deck"). A deque allows you to add and remove elements from both the head and the tail in O(1) time.

One of the most important use cases for the queue is when performing breadth-first search for trees and graphs, which we will cover later in the course.
