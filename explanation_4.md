# Explanation for the Code Implementation

# Decision Making:

1. #### Data Structure Choice:

- I opted to use a class named `Group` to represent each group in the Active Directory. This class contains attributes for the group's name, a list of sub-groups, and a list of users. I chose this structure because it allows for easy organization of groups and users in a hierarchical manner, reflecting the structure of Active Directory.
- Lists were used to store sub-groups and users within each group due to their simplicity and efficiency in appending elements and accessing them by index. Additionally, I chose lists because the number of sub-groups and users within each group is not fixed.

2. Algorithm Selection:

- I employed a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to efficiently traverse the hierarchy of groups within the Active Directory. DFS allows us to systematically explore each branch of the group hierarchy, checking for the presence of the target user in each group or sub-group.
- DFS was a suitable choice as it efficiently handles the traversal of hierarchical structures, ensuring that all possible paths are explored until either the user is found or all groups have been visited.

## Time Efficiency:

- **Traversal:** The DFS algorithm ensures that each group and sub-group is visited exactly once. Therefore, the time complexity of the `is_user_in_group` function is O(n), where n is the total number of groups in the Active Directory.
- **Membership Check:** Checking for the existence of a user within a group or sub-group has a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of users within the group or sub-group. However, since each user is checked at most once, the overall time complexity remains O(n + m), where n is the total number of groups and m is the total number of users in the Active Directory.

## Space Efficiency:

- **Data Storage:** The space complexity of storing the Active Directory hierarchy is O(n + m), where n is the total number of groups and m is the total number of users. This is because each group stores references to its sub-groups and users in lists.
- **Function Call Stack:** During the DFS traversal, the function call stack may grow up to the depth of the hierarchy. However, since the function only recurses to the depth of the hierarchy, the space complexity of the function call stack is O(h), where h is the maximum depth of the group hierarchy.

In conclusion, the implemented solution offers both time and space efficiency, ensuring that user membership within groups can be determined swiftly and without excessive memory usage.
