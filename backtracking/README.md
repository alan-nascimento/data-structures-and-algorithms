# Backtracking

## What is Backtracking?

Backtracking is an algorithm with a lot of overlap with DFS. It operates on a brute-force approach which is to try all possible solutions and backtrack when we hit a dead-end.

Imagine that we are trapped in a maze and we are trying to find our way out. We can try all possible paths until we find the correct one. If we hit a dead-end, we backtrack and try another path. This is the essence of backtracking.

## When to use Backtracking?

Backtracking is a good choice when we need to find all possible solutions to a problem. It is a good choice when we need to explore all possible paths to find the correct one.

## Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of backtracking is usually exponential. This is because we are trying all possible solutions. The space complexity is linear. This is because we are using recursion to explore all possible paths.

## Conclusion

Backtracking is a powerful algorithm that can be used to solve a variety of problems. It is a good choice when we need to find all possible solutions to a problem. It is a good choice when we need to explore all possible paths to find the correct one.
