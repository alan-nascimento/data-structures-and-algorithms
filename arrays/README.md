# Arrays

## Static Arrays

In statically typed languages like Java, C++ and C#, arrays have to have an allocated size and type when initialized. These are known as static arrays.

They are called static because the size of the array cannot change once declared. And once the array is full, it can not store additional elements. Some dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript do not have static arrays to begin with. They have an alternative, known as Dynamic Arrays.

## Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic Arrays are a much more common alternative to static arrays. They are useful because they can grow as elements are added. In JavaScript and Python, these are the default arrays.

Unlike static arrays, with dynamic arrays we don’t have to specify a size upon initialization.

In different languages, dynamic arrays may be assigned a default size - Java being 10 and C# being 4. Regardless, these are automatically resized at runtime as the arrays grow.

## Stacks

A stack is a data structure that supports a subset of operations from a dynamic array. With a stack you may only add and delete elements from one end of the array (referred to as the top of the stack).

In the physical world, a stack can be conceptualized by thinking of a stack of plates. You may grab a plate from the top or you may add a plate to the top. You cannot remove or add a plate to the middle of the stack. This is the same as the stack data structure.

Stacks are a dynamic data structure that operate on a LIFO (Last In First Out) manner. The last element added to the stack is the first element that comes out. The stack supports three operations - push, pop, peek.
