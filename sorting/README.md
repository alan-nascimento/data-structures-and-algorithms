# Sorting

## Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

### Time Complexity

-   Worst Case: O(n^2)
-   Best Case: O(n)
-   Average Case: O(n^2)

### Space Complexity

-   O(1)

## Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

### Time Complexity

-   Worst Case: O(n^2)
-   Best Case: O(n)
-   Average Case: O(n^2)

### Space Complexity

-   O(1)

## Selection Sort

Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n^2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.

### Time Complexity

-   Worst Case: O(n^2)
-   Best Case: O(n^2)
-   Average Case: O(n^2)

### Space Complexity

-   O(1)

## Merge Sort

Merge sort is an efficient, stable, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output.

### Time Complexity

-   Worst Case: O(n log n)
-   Best Case: O(n log n)
-   Average Case: O(n log n)

### Space Complexity

-   O(n)

## Quick Sort

Quicksort is an efficient sorting algorithm. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting.

### Time Complexity

-   Worst Case: O(n^2)
-   Best Case: O(n log n)
-   Average Case: O(n log n)

### Space Complexity

-   O(log n)

## Bucket Sort

Bucket sort, or bin sort, is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm.

### Time Complexity

-   Worst Case: O(n^2)
-   Best Case: O(n + k)
-   Average Case: O(n + k)

### Space Complexity

-   O(n)

## Heap Sort

Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It is not a stable sort.

### Time Complexity

-   Worst Case: O(n log n)
-   Best Case: O(n log n)
-   Average Case: O(n log n)

### Space Complexity

-   O(1)
